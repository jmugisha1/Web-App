# ToDo App

This is a simple ToDo web application that allows users to add tasks, mark them as completed, and delete them. The application uses HTML, CSS, and JavaScript

## Running the Application Locally

To run the application locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.

2. Navigate to the project directory.

3. Open the `index.html` file in a web browser.

## Building Docker Image and Running a Container

To build the Docker image and run a container using the image, make sure you have Docker installed on your system. Then, follow these steps:

1. Pull the Docker image from Docker Hub using the following command: `docker pull archmike/todo-app`

2. Build the container for the Docker image using the following command: `docker build -t archmike/todo-app`

3. Once the image is built successfully, you can run a container using the following command: `docker run -d -p 8080:80 todo-app`

This command will run a container named `todo-app` in detached mode (-d) and map port 8080 on your host to port 80 on the container.

4. Open a web browser and navigate to `http://localhost:8080` to access the ToDo application running inside the Docker container.

## Assumptions and Decisions

During the development process, the following assumptions and decisions were made:

1. **Data Persistence**: Data persistence is achieved using localStorage in the browser. This was chosen for simplicity and to avoid the need for a backend database.

2. **Styling**: Basic styling is provided using CSS. Additional styling and design improvements can be made as needed.

3. **Framework/Libraries**: The application was developed using pure HTML, CSS, and JavaScript without the use of any frameworks or libraries to keep it lightweight and simple.

4. **Docker Image**: The Docker image is based on the NGINX Alpine image for serving static files. This was chosen for its lightweight nature and suitability for hosting frontend applications.

5. **Port Mapping**: When running the Docker container, port 8080 on the host is mapped to port 80 on the container. This can be adjusted as needed depending on the host environment.
